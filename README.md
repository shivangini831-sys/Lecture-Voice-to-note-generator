Lecture Voice to Notes Generator 

1. Abstract

The Lecture Voice to Notes Generator is an AI-based web application developed to convert recorded lecture audio into structured text notes. The system uses speech recognition technology to transcribe spoken content into readable text. It reduces manual effort and improves efficiency in note-taking. The application is developed using Python and Streamlit and integrates the Vosk speech recognition model for offline transcription.

2. Introduction

Students often find it difficult to take accurate and complete notes while listening to lectures. Manual note-taking can lead to missing important information. This project provides an automated solution that converts lecture audio into written text efficiently and accurately. The application is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible.

3. Problem Statement

Manual note-taking during lectures is time-consuming and may result in incomplete documentation. There is a need for an automated system that converts lecture speech into text to ensure accurate and complete notes.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system accepts a lecture audio file as input and processes it using a speech recognition model. The application converts speech into text format and displays the transcribed content on the interface. The generated notes are saved as text files for future reference.

5. Objectives

To develop a system that converts lecture voice into text.

To simplify the note-taking process for students.

To implement speech recognition in a practical application.

To build an interactive and user-friendly web interface.

6. Key Features

Upload lecture audio files.

Automatic speech-to-text conversion.

Generate readable and structured notes.

Save transcribed text in output files.

Offline speech recognition capability.

7. Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

Speech Recognition Model: Vosk

Supporting Libraries:

wave

json

subprocess

tempfile

Version Control: Git and GitHub

8. System Workflow

The user uploads a lecture audio file.

The system converts the audio into WAV format if required.

The Vosk model processes the audio data.

Speech is recognized and converted into text.

The transcribed text is displayed on the screen.

The output is saved as a text file in the output directory.


11. Results

The system successfully converts lecture audio into readable text with satisfactory accuracy. It reduces the time and effort required for manual note-taking and improves productivity for students.

12. Future Scope

Integration of automatic text summarization.

Support for multiple languages.

Improved punctuation and formatting.

Export notes in PDF format.

Real-time microphone recording support.

Deployment on a cloud platform.
